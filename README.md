I've read through a lot of other people's Claude Code hooks.

It seems they can all be categorized into 3 general groups:

1. One-liner shell scripts.
2. Longer scripts (often in Python because Anthropic's docs for hooks are like that).
3. Compiled binaries.

I don't like overcomplicating things, so I like being able to use one-liner shell scripts. But I can't remember them all.

The ./one-liner-shell-scripts subdirectory has files for this.
