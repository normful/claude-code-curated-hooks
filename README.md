I've read through a lot of other people's Claude Code hooks.

It seems they can all be categorized into 3 general groups:

1. One-liner shell scripts.
2. Longer scripts, in various languages, often Python.
3. Compiled binaries.

This is a collection of the first two types above.

I'm only including longer Python scripts written using the https://github.com/GowayLee/cchooks library, because they seem relatively straightforward to maintain.

# Installation of one-liner scripts

For one-liner shell script hooks: Install with `./install-one-liner-hook.sh`

# Installation of longer Python hooks
