# claude-code-curated-hooks

I've read through a lot of other people's Claude Code hooks.

It seems they can all be categorized into 3 general groups:

1. One-liner shell scripts.
2. Longer scripts.
3. Compiled binaries.

This is my collection of the first two types above (one-liner shell scripts and longer scripts).

I've chosen to write longer scripts with the https://github.com/GowayLee/cchooks library, which looked like the best library for doing that as of Sep 2025.
